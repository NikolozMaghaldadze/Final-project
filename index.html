              Japan, island country lying off the east coast of Asia. It
              consists of a great string of islands in a northeast-southwest arc
              that stretches for approximately 1,500 miles (2,400 km) through
              the western North Pacific Ocean. Nearly the entire land area is
              taken up by the country's four main islands; from north to south
              these are Hokkaido (Hokkaidō), Honshu (Honshū), Shikoku, and
              Kyushu (Kyūshū). Honshu is the largest of the four, followed in
              size by Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku. In addition, there are
              numerous smaller islands, the major groups of which are the Ryukyu
              (Nansei) Islands (including the island of Okinawa) to the south
              and west of Kyushu and the Izu, Bonin (Ogasawara), and Volcano
              (Kazan) islands to the south and east of central Honshu. The
              national capital, Tokyo (Tōkyō), in east-central Honshu, is one of
              the world's most populous cities.The Japanese landscape is rugged,
              with more than four-fifths of the land surface consisting of
              mountains. There are many active and dormant volcanoes, including
              Mount Fuji (Fuji-san), which, at an elevation of 12,388 feet
              (3,776 metres), is Japan's highest mountain. Abundant
              precipitation and the generally mild temperatures throughout most
              of the country have produced a lush vegetation cover and, despite
              the mountainous terrain and generally poor soils, have made it
              possible to raise a variety of crops. Japan has a large and, to a
              great extent, ethnically homogeneous population, which is heavily
              concentrated in the low-lying areas along the Pacific coast of
              Honshu.Complexity and contrast are the keynotes of life in Japan—a
              country possessing an intricate and ancient cultural tradition yet
              one that, since 1950, has emerged as one of the world's most
              economically and technologically advanced societies. Heavy
              emphasis is placed on education, and Japan is one of the world's
              most literate countries. Tension between old and new is apparent
              in all phases of Japanese life. A characteristic sensitivity to
              natural beauty and a concern with form and balance are evident in
              such cities as Kyōto and Nara, as well as in Japan's ubiquitous
              gardens.
